Assignment 4 - Brevet Calculator

Still to-do:
    []Make Functional
    []Expand HTML past testing file

I have working python modules for operations on brevets, brevet_test.py confirms that.
However, at the point that I call brevet_calc.handle_new_time I get an internal server error. I am not
certain what is causing this, though my suspicion is a discrepency in data types.
I can calculate the distance if the console is checked or the test module run,
but the html display itself is nothing more than a display for the time being.
Currently only KM is supported in operation.
